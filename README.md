# Movie Tracker Project

I wrote this application in React for my personal whim. I wanted to keep track of the movies that I watched and want to watch.
I used [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com) to get movie details like poster, imdb rating, etc.

To be able to run this project you need an API key from [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com) and [Back4App Account](https://www.back4app.com/)
